## Installation

Windows and Mac OS installers can be found under [releases](https://github.com/rachidlamouri/waiting-room/releases/tag/v1.0.2).

The application is not signed, so your operating system will warn you that the application is not trusted.
You can bypass the warning if you trust the application.

## Controls

This game has full controller support! Just plug in a USB gamepad and press any button to start using a controller.
The game also lists the controls on screen when necessary (controller graphics are for an Xbox One controller, but any gamepad should work).

Keyboard and mouse uses `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Q`, and `SPACE`. Controller uses the `Directional Pad`, the `A` button, and the `B` button (the bottom and right face buttons on the right of the controller).

Press `ESC` on the keyboard or `Start` on a controller to open the pause menu.

Pressing `ESC` from the main menu exits the game.

## Bonus Level

There is a bonus multiplayer level with two minigames after beating the main story. Controls are shown on screen for both players.
The second player can use the `Arrow Keys` and `?` or a controller (controls listed above). The game supports two controllers at once.

## How to Uninstall

The application is installed like any other application on your operating system, so the uninstall process would be the same.
